To store data I used an android resource directory which contains the files username and password
The username file store the username jung all lowercase 
the password file stores the password comp415 all lowercase alphanumeric 
this is used for validation in main activity
my files are named mainactivity and welcome I did not name them the same as the guideline(sorry)
 	 the project was named p3 so the package should be named p3 for project 3 hence the abbreviation
you will need to update the android manifest to make the project work 
thanks,
